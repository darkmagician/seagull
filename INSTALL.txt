To compile Seagull from the source:
- Edit build.conf to fit your needs (default should be OK)
- run "./build.ksh -target clean"
- run "./build.ksh -target all"
- run "./install.ksh" to copy Seagull binaries and config files _or_
  Seagull binaries are in build-x.y.z/: copy all of them in /usr/local/bin/
- Add /usr/local/bin in your PATH environment variable 
  (eg. export "PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin")
- Execution environment are in exe-env/XXX-env/, XXX being the protocol
- Go in one execution environment, then "cd run", then start a server script
  in a terminal session and a client script in another terminal session
- Seagull is running!
- From there, follow the documentation: http://gull.sourceforge.net/

SCTP support:
- To enable SCTP support, download sctplib-1.0.4.tar.gz and 
  socketapi-1.7.0.tar.gz from http://www.sctp.de/ in external-lib-src 
  directory. Note: glib 1.x > 1.2.8 is a pre-requisite to sctplib
  and socketapi. You will need to install it also.
- Modify build-ext-lib.conf to match sctplib and socketapi filenames 
  (library versions might have been changed)
- Run build-ext-lib.ksh
- Modify build.conf to add SCTP support (uncomment BUILD_9_ lines)
- Compile Seagull (see before)

TLS support:
- To enable TLS support, download openssl-0.9.8 or greater in
  external-lib-src directory.
- Modify build-ext-lib.conf to match openssl filename
  (library versions might have been changed)
- Run build-ext-lib.ksh
- Modify build.conf to add TLS support (uncomment BUILD_10_ lines)
- Compile Seagull (see before)
